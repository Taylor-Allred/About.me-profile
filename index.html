				<p>I started working when I turned 16. My first ever job was a courtsey clerk (bagger) at an Albertsons, I have always had a knack for working hard and efficient. Since I started work at my first job I have never been out of work for more than a month (if not less). My goal whenever I would have to find a new job would take a full day and go down a street applying at every store or business that I qualified for, it was very effective, using this strategy I was usually able to find a job within a couple of days.
				</p>
				<p>I have never been fired from a job, and I have never quit a job without giving at least a full two week notice. The majority of time that I have had to quit was when I had to move (usually for school). I am a very loyal employee and you will be hard pressed to find someone who works harder at their job.
				</p>
				<p>I grew up in the small town of Spanish Fork, I bounced around a few times to different cities but always found myself back in Spanish Fork. Even though it was more or less a farm town I always loved technology even at a young age, I remember playing video games and messing around with my Parent's computer, a windows ME desktop, and found that computers came very easy to me. Unfourtnetly in school we didn't have very many programs that helped advance my love and knowlege of computers except for basic typing. I started to grow away from technology in general and really only kept a foot in the door with video games.
				</p>
				<p>After HighSchool I went to a Universty, I planned on becoming an Aerospace Engineer. That did not go very well, I floundered, I was treading water trying to keep my head above it, I failed. I ended up dropping out after the first year with a shiny new Student loan I had to pay for and no education to show for it. I ended up having to rethink my entire life and what I wanted to do and what I wanted out of it. What I found took me back to my roots. I found a school called MATC, a technical school, and a program they had was an IT program. I saw it and decided hey, why not, I like computers and it is teaching me about computers. I started it and loved it. Everything came smoothly and fluidly to me, I ended up getting my A+ cert and started on networking, about half way through I started to bog down. It still came easily but I wasn't enjoying it, it just seemed tedious and boring.
				</p>
				<p>I talked to a brother of mine who is in app development. He suggested to look into computer programming. He started me on a path to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and several other languages. Fast forward about 6 months and I have learned the basics for the three that I listed and am loving it, simillary to the IT program this came very easy to me, but, it is also very fun, even though it can still be a bit tedius at times typing everything out it is all worth it to see how coding works and makes entire web pages. I ended up taking one of the first DevMountain Code bootcamps and am rapidly improving my skills. I plan on constantly improving my skills and plan on finding a full time career in the web development feild ASAP.
